# Back2me

> Back2me is a personal belongings lending tracker that helps users record borrowed items, keep track of borrowers and return dates, and manage their lending history.

**Live demo:** https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/ <!-- GitHub Pages is set up already; replace if you host elsewhere -->
**Demo video:** `docs/demo.mp4` (link it here once it exists)
**Course:** Applications Development and Emerging Technologies (6ADET), Holy Angel University
**Author:** Shannon Kyle A. Priniel

This repository lives in the author's own GitHub account and is public on
purpose. There is no `student.json` here and there should not be one: see
`docs/06-security-and-privacy.md` for what a public repo means for secrets and
personal data.

## Screenshots

Put two or three real screenshots at phone size in `docs/assets/`, then replace
this paragraph with them:

```markdown
| Home | Detail | Add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Home](docs/assets/screen-home.png) | ![Detail](docs/assets/screen-detail.png) | ![Add](docs/assets/screen-add.png) |
```

A repo without screenshots reads as abandoned, whatever the code says.

## What it does

Back2me helps users organize their personal belongings and track items they lend to other people.

- Item Management: Add, edit, view, and delete personal items, including their category, description, condition, and availability.
- Lending Records: Record which item was borrowed, who borrowed it, the borrow date, and the expected return date.
- Return Tracking: Update lending records when an item is returned and keep the item's availability status updated.
- History: View previous lending transactions, including the borrower, dates, and final status.
- User Profile: View and edit personal profile information.

Push notifications for upcoming return dates are planned as a stretch feature and are not part of the core MVP unless implemented.

## Built with

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Flutter (Dart) |
| State | `setState` / provider / riverpod (say which) |
| Storage | shared_preferences / Hive / Drift / Firebase / Supabase / other |
| Other packages | list the ones that matter, with a word on why |

## Running it yourself

```bash
flutter pub get
cp .env.example .env      # only if your app needs keys, see below
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080. Requires Flutter (run `flutter --version` and
put yours here).

### Environment variables

This project reads its configuration from a `.env` file that is **not** in the
repository. Copy `.env.example`, fill in your own values, and never commit the
result.

| Variable | What it is | Where to get one |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXAMPLE_API_KEY` | ... | ... |

## Privacy and secrets

Required section. Two or three honest sentences:

- What personal data this app stores, if any, and where it goes.
- Where the secrets live (`.env` locally, repository secrets in the deploy
  workflow) and what protects the data on the service side (Firestore rules,
  Supabase RLS, or "nothing leaves the device").
- Confirm that all sample data, screenshots and the video contain **no real
  personal information**.

| Document | |
| --- | --- |
| [Proposal](docs/01-proposal.md) | the problem, the users, the scope |
| [Mockup and wireframes](docs/02-mockup.md) | what it looks like, and the screen flow |
| [Design system](docs/03-design-system.md) | colors, type, spacing, components |
| [Weekly reports](docs/04-weekly-reports.md) | what happened each week |
| [Demo video](docs/05-demo-video.md) | the recording and what it shows |
| [Start here](START-HERE.md) | how this repo works (delete once you have read it) |
| [Security and privacy](docs/06-security-and-privacy.md) | the checklist, filled in |

## Status and what is next

Be honest. What works, what is half done, what you would build next. An honest
"known issues" section reads better than a claim the reader disproves in thirty
seconds.

## Credits

- Packages: see `pubspec.yaml`
- Assets, icons, 3D models, sounds: name the author and the licence for each
- People who helped, and how

## AI use

If you used AI while building this, say so here. Honest disclosure is the
standard in this course and increasingly outside it, and reporting heavy use
accurately costs you nothing.

This section is the last 10 points of the finals badge, and it wants three
things:

![Built with AI assistance](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-AI%20assistance-0b5fff)

- the badge above, or one you like better
- a line naming which assistant you used and how much of the work it touched
- a link to [AI-USAGE.md](AI-USAGE.md), where the full account lives

Keep the detail in `AI-USAGE.md` rather than here. This section is the summary a
visitor reads; that file is the record the badge is graded from.

## Licence

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Change it if you want different terms.
